# Akkatecture
A CQRS+ES Toolkit for Akka.NET.

# Motivations
Doing domain driven design in a distributed scenario is quite tricky. And even more so when you add CQRS and ES style mechanics to your business domain logic it does cause quite a few uncomfortable realizations.

# What it is not
This is not meant to be a framework for anything in particular. This toolkit is made such that you can enhance your Akka.NET based CQRS/ES solution, at anytime you can break out of the framework to do as you please within the Akka framework.
