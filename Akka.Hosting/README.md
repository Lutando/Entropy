# Akka Hosting Example

This example shows how to host akka.net using the new 2.1 [generic host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-2.1) abstractions.


Don't do this yet because akka clustering in  2.1 under Linux seems [unstable](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/3506).
